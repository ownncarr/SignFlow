# SignFlow  
**Breaking Barriers Between Speakers and Signers**  

SignFlow is a **cross-platform communication app** designed to bridge the gap between **speakers** and **sign language users** in real-time.  
By leveraging **AI-powered sign language recognition** and **speech-to-text technology**, SignFlow enables **seamless, inclusive conversations** between people who communicate differently.  

Whether youâ€™re in a **meeting**, a **classroom**, or a **casual chat**, SignFlow ensures that **no one is left out** of the conversation.

## ðŸ›  How It Works

1. **Select Communication Mode**  
   - **Speaker Mode** â€“ For spoken language users.  
   - **Signer Mode** â€“ For sign language users.  
   - **Mixed Conversation** â€“ Both participants can speak/sign.  

2. **Input Communication**  
   - **Signers**: Use your deviceâ€™s camera to capture hand gestures. The app interprets them into text/speech.  
   - **Speakers**: Speak into the deviceâ€™s microphone. The app converts speech into text for the signer.  

3. **View and Respond**  
   - All responses appear in real time, ensuring a **natural conversation flow**.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset & Model

- **Dataset**: Sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) for sign language gesture recognition.  
- **Model**: Trained using deep learning with TensorFlow/Keras.  
- **Note**: The `.h5` trained model file is **not included** in this repository due to GitHub file size limitations.  
- Instead, the repository contains the **training scripts** so you can retrain the model locally.
